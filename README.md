# Hydroponics Application

## Overview
This is a Python-based application designed to monitor and control a hydroponics system. The application runs on a Raspberry Pi, leveraging various sensors and actuators to automate and optimize the hydroponics process. It is managed as a `systemd` service for reliable startup and background operation.

## Features
- **Sensor Monitoring**:
  - pH level
  - Electrical conductivity (EC)
  - Water temperature
  - Air temperature and humidity
- **Actuator Control**:
  - Fertilization pumps
  - Water pump
  - Fans
  - Lights

## System Requirements
- **Hardware**:
  - Raspberry Pi (any version with GPIO support and connectivity)
  - pH, EC, water temperature, air temperature, and humidity sensors
  - Actuators: pumps, fans, lights, etc.
- **Software**:
  - Python 3.x
  - `systemd` for service management

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
